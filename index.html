        <h2>The Mariner 1 Spacecraft, 1962</h2>
        <p>
            The first entry in our rundown goes right back to the sixties.
Before the summer of love or the invention of the lava lamp, NASA launched a data-gathering unmanned
space mission to fly past Venus. It did not go to plan.
The mariner 1 space probe barely made it out of Cape Canaveral before the rocket veered dangerously
off course. Worried that the rocket was heading towards a crash-landing on earth, NASA engineers
issued a self-destruct command and the craft was obliterated about 290 seconds after launch.
An Investigation revealed the cause to be a very simple software error. A hyphen was omitted in a line of
code, which meant that incorrect guidance signals were sent to the spacecraft. The overall cost of the
omission was reported to be more than $18 million at the time (about $169 million in today’s world).

        <h2>F-35 Fighter Plane Glitch</h2>
        <p>A couple of years ago, a software glitch in an F-35 Joint Strike Fighter jet was identified to have a bug.
            The bug actually caused planes to incorrectly detect and lock in on the wrong targets when flying in
            formation.
            As the company explained, each of the planes flying in formation must detect a target from varying
            angles. But the software was unable to differentiate between one target and multiple targets. In essence,
            the F-35s were seeing double. (And that’s not something you want when flying in formation at high
            speeds and high altitudes.)</p>

        <h2>Uber Software Bug Catches “Cheater”</h2>
        <p>
            Okay, let’s take a temporary break from the serious ones. Here’s one that’s pretty funny (unless you’re
the main character of the story, that is.)
In France, a bug within the Uber app actually revealed a man’s affair with another woman to his wife. It
ultimately led to a divorce and got Uber slapped with a $45 million lawsuit.
The bug, which causes Uber notifications to be pushed to a device even after you log out of the account
on a specific device, actually sent several notifications to the Frenchman’s wife – clearly outlining his
rendezvous to his mistress’ flat. The wife allegedly received the notifications because her husband had
once called an Uber from her phone.

        <h2>Toyota Car Accidents</h2>
        <p>
            A few years back, Toyota drivers began reporting a troubling issue: Their cars were accelerating without
them actually touching the gas pedal. And after a few accidents, which were carefully investigated, it was
discovered that software errors in the system were causing these dangerous issues.
According to reports, the software installed on these Toyota cars had a variety of issues like memory
corruption, disabling safety systems, incorrect memory handling, and systems with single points of
failure. Toyota eventually recalled millions of vehicles and the company’s stock price would eventually
drop by 20 percent in a matter of weeks.

        <h2>MERCEDES BENZ </h2>
        <p>
            A failure In the eCall software has led to Mercedes-Benz recalling 1.29 million vehicles to help owners
avoid emergency-call location error. The eCall system in affected vehicles may give an incorrect location
for a vehicle after a crash. The failure in eCall software “may not provide a vehicle’s correct location to
emergency responders after a crash”, reports Car and Driver.
